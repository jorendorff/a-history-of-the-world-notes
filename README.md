## What is this?

[*A History of the World in 100 Objects*](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/)
is a series of 15-minute radio programs by British Museum director Neil MacGregor,
first broadcast in 2010.

This repository contains notes for using the series in homeschooling as
an introduction to world history.

Fair warning: like most homeschooling materials, this will be pretty quirky.
I know next to nothing about history myself. Oh - also I am only **15%** done.


## How do I use these notes?

**You'll need 30 minutes a day** to spend on history with your student.

*   Above, you'll see a long list of links, like
    [001-Mummy-of-Hornedjitef.md](001-Mummy-of-Hornedjitef.md).
    Each day, click on a link to see notes for one episode.

*   Discuss the "Before listening" questions.  Go fast, skip what you
    already know, and use the internet to look things up.

*   Under "Listen", click the link and listen to the episode online.
    For best results, actually sit there and listen with your student.
    Or, [get the book](http://www.powells.com/book/history-of-the-world-in-100-objects-9780670022700/17-3)
    and read together.

*   The notes also include discussion questions, links, and so
    forth. Take what you want, and leave the rest.

    To me, the discussion questions are the whole point, as it's
    remembering what you've learned, putting it into words, doubting it,
    rethinking it, and going further that really fixes any lesson in the
    mind.

Of course, you can easily supplement all this with books from your local
library.


## What makes this series good?

*A History of the World in 100 Objects* is:

*   *palatable* - It draws you in. Have a listen and you'll see what I
    mean.

*   *introductory* - You don't have to be a historian yourself to teach
    from it.

*   *smart* - It questions assumptions; it makes insightful
    observations; it includes expert voices; it makes connections
    between little events and major world-changing developments.

*   *orderly* - Go on, laugh; but the series is a serious attempt to
    tell a comprehensive story, in roughly chronological order,
    [hitting all the most important themes](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/programme/)
    and wrapping up on time. The first ten episodes address human
    evolution and prehistory. Halfway through, you'll find yourself on
    the Silk Road, in a series of five episodes that focus on the
    exchange of goods and ideas between civilizations. And in episode
    100, you'll reach the present dayâ€”a feat that no history course I
    took ever managed to achieve.


## Why does this matter to homeschoolers?

The purpose of any survey course is to provide the "spine" of an
education, so that what the student learns later doesn't have to sit in
isolation in his or her memory. There will already be something there to
attach it to. I think this is especially useful for history.

But to provide that spine for world history, you need a single resource
that makes an honest attempt to cover all the important points, from
prehistory to the present. And that's a problem. Most comprehensive
surveys are textbooks, and they are not very engaging. The most engaging
history resources hop around in time, from one dramatic story to
another, with no real plan in mind.

My hope is that this series, which is both excellent and comprehensive,
is the spine I've been looking for. Our experiment is ongoing.
