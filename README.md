[*A History of the World in 100 Objects*](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/)
is a series of 15-minute radio programs by British Museum director Neil MacGregor,
first broadcast in 2010.

This repository contains notes for using the series in homeschooling as
an introduction to world history.

Fair warning: like most homeschooling materials, this will be pretty quirky.
I know next to nothing about history myself. Oh - also I am only **5%** done.


## How to use these notes

These are notes for one-on-one study. The idea is, the teacher (that's
you) and student (aged 10 to 1.2 million years) find a quiet place and
**spend 30 minutes on history each day.**

I know—who has the time, right? Not me. But if you make the time, I bet
you'll find this rewarding.

1.  Go to https://github.com/jorendorff/a-history-of-the-world-notes and
    click on one of the episodes in the list.
    You'll see a page with these sections:

2.  **Before listening** - Things to know before listening. Your student
    will know some of this stuff already. Don't make it a chore. Go
    quickly and use the internet.

3.  **Listen** - This section contains a link to the episode online.
    Click the link, then the big pink "Listen to this
    programme" button.

    Or, find *A History of the World in 100 Objects*
    as a podcast and listen to it that way.

4.  **Discussion** - Some suggested topics. A lot of these are review of
    what's in the radio program. Just recalling what you've heard and
    putting it in your own words helps fix it in your mind. (Also, it's
    normal to miss, or fail to grasp, bits and pieces of each show. It
    moves pretty fast.) Other questions are conversation starters. You
    and your student are bright, curious people, so you'll probably want
    to talk about your own stuff—and that's great.

There might also be a **Links** section and maybe a **Rationale**
section where I talk about how dumb I am and why I made the dumb
decisions I made.

If you do this every day for 100 days, then you'll be 100 days older—well
on your way to becoming a historical treasure yourself!
You may also pick up a smattering of world history.
The purpose of any survey course is
to provide a "spine" so that later, when you learn some historical fact,
it won't have to sit in isolation in your memory.
You'll have something already there to attach it to.

Good luck. Let me know how it goes. :)
