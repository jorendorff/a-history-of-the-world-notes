[*A History of the World in 100 Objects*](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/)
is a series of 15-minute radio programs by British Museum director Neil MacGregor,
first broadcast in 2010.

This repository contains notes for using the series in homeschooling as
an introduction to world history.

Fair warning: like most homeschooling materials, this will be pretty quirky.
I know next to nothing about history myself.
