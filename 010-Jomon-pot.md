## Discussion

Do you think the first pot was really made accidentally?

The Jomon people developed pottery thousands of years before
agriculture. Why didn't any other hunter-gatherer peoples have pottery?
What was special about the Jomon? (Hint: It has to do with what they
ate.)

Are acorns edible?

How did people store food before pottery?

Are the patterns on the pot decorative or functional?

The program says that "pots change your diet." How so?

Niel MacGregor says, "As an outsider, I find the meticulous attention to
detail and the patterning of the surface, and the long continuity of
Jomon traditions, already very Japanese." Do you agree?

[Jomon culture](http://jomon-japan.jp/en/jomon-cultur/) shows pottery
from different periods that shows several distinct styles, though not
nearly the variety mentioned by Takoshi Doi in the program.

"The elaborate and refined
[Japanese tea ceremony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_tea_ceremony)
is meant to demonstrate respect through grace and good etiquette[...]."
Wikipedia describes
[the usual sequence of a noon *chaji*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_tea_ceremony#Usual_sequence_of_ceremony)
in some detail, concluding that it "can last up to four hours, depending
on the type of ceremony performed, the number of guests, and the types
of meal and tea served."

The line of poetry quoted in this program is by Victorian poet
[Robert Browning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Browning),
from his poem
["Rabbi Ben Ezra"](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/43775).
It's the one that starts "Grow old along with me! / The best is yet to
be" and then gets difficult in a hurry. Here are two verses leading up
to the quoted line:

> Ay, note that Potter's wheel,  
> That metaphor! and feel  
> Why time spins fast, why passive lies our clay, —  
> Thou, to whom fools propound,  
> When the wine makes its round,  
> "Since life fleets, all is change; the Past gone, seize to-day!"
>
> Fool! All that is, at all,  
> Lasts ever, past recall;  
> Earth changes, but thy soul and God stand sure:  
> What entered into thee,  
> *That* was, is, and shall be:  
> Time's wheel runs back or stops: Potter and clay endure.

So the potter is God; the clay, the human soul. Usually when someone
quotes this kind of poetry it's to borrow the poet's metaphor. Here the
potter and clay are indeed metaphorical, but MacGregor instead calls
upon the literal meaning of the words.


## Rationale

If you want to talk with your student about the blurry line between
cultural stereotypes and the actual content of culture, MacGregor's
statement about attention to detail and continuity of tradition being
"very Japanese" is an adorable launching point. I left it out for now,
partly because it would take over the lesson and partly because it may
be too benign an example to start with. Also: I expect plenty more
opportunities in future episodes.
