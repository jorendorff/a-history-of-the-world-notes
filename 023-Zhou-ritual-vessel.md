## Discussion

Why is the history of these two early Chinese dynasties mainly recovered
from pieces of bronze like this *gui*?

Suppose archaeologists dig up our civilization three thousand years from
now. What will be their primary source of information about us?

How do we show respect for the dead in our culture?

What is the Mandate of Heaven?

The archaeologist and art historian Wang Tao draws a parallel between
the Mandate of Heaven and democracy. What if anything do they have in
common? Is there a function that both serve?

(research) The script used in Shang and Zhou bronzes is a direct
ancestor of modern Chinese writing. There is one even earlier source of
written Chinese characters. What is it?
