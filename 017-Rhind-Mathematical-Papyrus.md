## Discussion

How is papyrus made?

Why are there more surviving texts from Babylon around this time than from Egypt?

The episode mentions that Egypt required civil servants who could, among other things:

*   supervise building works
*   organize payments
*   manage food supplies
*   plan troop movements
*   compute the flood levels of the Nile

What sort of math might be involved in each of these tasks?

What does the papyrus tell us about daily life in Egypt?

The mathematical puzzle in this episode is fairly easy: "If in 7 houses
there are 7 cats, if each cat catches 7 mice, if each mouse had eaten 7
ears of corn, and each ear of corn, if sown, would have produced 7
gallons of grain, how many things are mentioned in total?"
Describe exactly how you would solve it.
What arithmetic operations do you need to know how to compute?

The Plato quote is from the *Laws*.

Khan Academy has [a video attempting to explain the word
*abstract*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOYRb2sYrL0),
a word used in this episode to contrast the very practical mathematics
of the Rhind papyrus with what would follow in Euclid and beyond.
