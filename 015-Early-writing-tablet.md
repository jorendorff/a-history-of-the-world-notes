## Discussion

Where was the tablet made?

The program proposes that writing has "had more impact on the evolution
of human society than any other invention". What do you think? Are there
other possible candidates, inventions with even more significant
consequences?

Cities became "too big to be run by word of mouth". What sort of
situation do you think this refers to?

The program talks about writing as a new way for rulers to control their
cities and subjects. But how exactly does this work?

"It needs to be fair," says Gus O'Donnell, referring to the payment
documented on the tablet. Why does it need to be fair?

"You could say that this isn't writing in the strict sense." Do you
agree that "real writing" is phonetic? (research) Are Chinese characters
pictographs, or are they phonetic? Or both?

(research) Wikipedia:
"[The cuneiform script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform_script#Proto-literate_period)
was developed from pictographic proto-writing in the late 4th millennium
BCE. Mesopotamia's 'proto-literate' period spans roughly the 35th to
32nd centuries. The first documents unequivocally written in
[Sumerian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_language) date to the
31st century at Jemdet Nasr." There's a contrast here between
"pictographic proto-writing" and writing "in Sumerian". What's the
difference really?

If the words on the tablet don't constitute "real writing", what about the
numbers? Do you think they count as "real" numbers?

"Only later does writing move from rations to emotions; the accountants
get there before the poets." Why might poets not have been interested in
pictographic writing? Can you write a poem in pictographs?

[John Searle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Searle) is a lucid
thinker and writer. His 1969 book _Speech Acts_ is pretty strong stuff
if you think that talking is about exchanging information. I think his
comments in this program make more sense if you listen to them with
the idea of speech acts in mind.  Searle is also famous for
[the Chinese Room argument](http://www.consciousentities.com/searle.htm).

Whilst Cabinet Secretary,
[Gus O'Donnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_O%27Donnell) was
regularly referred to within the Civil Service, and subsequently in the
popular press, as *GOD*; this was *mainly* because of his initials.

The epic poem telling of the invention of writing is
[Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enmerkar_and_the_Lord_of_Aratta).


## Rationale

Gus O'Donnell makes a pun on the term "liquidity crisis" which I thought
not worth a pre-work question.
