## Discussion

Where was the tablet made?

The program proposes that writing has "had more impact on the evolution
of human society than any other invention". What do you think? Are there
other possible candidates, inventions with even more significant
consequences?

Cities became "too big to be run by word of mouth". What sort of
situation do you think this refers to?

The program talks about writing as a new way for rulers to control their
cities and subjects. But how exactly does this work?

"It needs to be fair," says Gus O'Donnell, referring to the payment
documented on the tablet. Why does it need to be fair? How might it be
unfair without written records?

"You cannot really do higher mathematics or even more complex forms of
philosophical argument[...], unless you have some way of writing it down
and scanning it." (John Searle.) Do you agree?

"You could say that this isn't writing in the strict sense." Do you
agree that "real writing" is phonetic? (research) Are Chinese characters
pictographs, or are they phonetic? Or both?

How would you write the phrase "of the people, by the people, for the
people" using pictographs? What kind of words are easy to write as
pictographs, and what kind are harder?

If the words on the tablet aren't "real writing", what about the
numbers? Do you think they count as "real" numbers?

"Only later does writing move from rations to emotions; the accountants
get there before the poets." Why might poets not have been interested in
pictographic writing? Can you write a poem in pictographs?

(research) Find more pictures of clay tablets with writing on them. Most
look more like modern writing than the pictographs on this tablet. What
is this kind of writing called?

[John Searle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Searle)'s 1969 book
_Speech Acts_ is pretty strong stuff if you think that talking is about
exchanging information. I think his comments in this program make more
sense if you listen to them with the idea of speech acts in mind.
Searle is also famous for
[the Chinese Room argument](http://www.consciousentities.com/searle.htm).

"Whilst Cabinet Secretary,
[Gus O'Donnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_O%27Donnell) was
regularly referred to within the Civil Service, and subsequently in the
popular press, as *GOD*; this was mainly because of his initials."

The epic poem telling of the invention of writing is
[Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enmerkar_and_the_Lord_of_Aratta).

## Rationale

Gus O'Donnell makes a pun on the term "liquidity crisis" which I thought
not worth a pre-work question.
