## Before listening

What is *Homo sapiens*?

What is an Ice Age? When did the most recent one end?

What is *naturalism* in art?

## Discussion

The program says that something dramatic happened to the human brain
about 50,000 years ago. What is the evidence?

Why were reindeer significant to the people who produced this carving?

What evidence is there that the artist was a butcher?

What technology was used to make this carving? The program lists four techniques.

The program says that Ice Age art "uses perspective". What does that mean?

Are you convinced that prehistoric art has a religious significance?
