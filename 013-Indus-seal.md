## Discussion

(research) The program says that the Indus civilization covered about
200,000 square miles. How big is that? What's a familiar country or
state that covers about the same area?

What were Indus seals were used for?

"Is it possible that these societies were based not on coercion but on
consensus?" Does the program ever answer this question? What do you
think?

What were the likely causes of the decline of the Indus civilization?

(research) The program mentions that the cities of the Indus Valley
civilization "show no signs of being fortified". First of all, is this
really so remarkable? What would fortification look like in this era?
How was Babylon (for example) fortified?

(research) Is it even true that the Indus Valley cities "show no signs
of being fortified"? Part of Mohenjo-Daro was called "the Citadel" by the
archaeologists who excavated it. What was it? Was it really a citadel?
How does
[Wikipedia describe Mohenjo-daro's fortifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohenjo-daro)?
Were there city walls? What about Harappa?

Why has the Indus script proven so difficult to decipher?

(research) "Since the early 1900s, people have been trying to decipher
them - nowadays of course using computers[.]" How would computers be
helpful in deciphering a forgotten script? One way to see how they could
at least be convenient is to try solving a cryptogram, first using a pen
and paper, and then using
[cryptograms.org](http://cryptograms.org/play.php), which offers a
little computer help. (And here's a fairly easy cryptogram to solve by
hand: KENVSGLB WBS VIBWONKX KIO OEL FMGSNWB PBMO YENKE OEL HMLO XHLBSX

[Richard Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rogers), British
modernist architect. "Mr. Rogers earned a reputation as a high-tech
iconoclast with the completion of the 1977

with its exposed skeleton of brightly coloured tubes for mechanical
systems."

The most famous pieces of Indus Valley art are the

and the
[Priest-King](https://www.harappa.com/slide/priest-king-mohenjo-daro) of
Mohenjo-Daro.

Another possible environmental factor in the decline of the Indus Valley
civilization was increased soil salinity. According to a 1985 source,
"Increased salinity of soil made the land [around the town of Lothal]
inhospitable to life, including crops."
([Wikipedia: Lothal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lothal))

The series has now dedicated a show each to the Mesopotamian, Egyptian,
and Indus Valley civilizations. Two others arose around this time:
[Norte Chico civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norte_Chico_civilization)
in what is now Peru; and
[early Chinese civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shang_dynasty)
in the Yellow River valley. The
[Olmecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olmec) are another apparently
independent Neolithic civilization. We'll hear from them in episode 29.

[The partition of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India). "In
the riots which preceded the partition in the Punjab Province, it is
believed that between 200,000 and 2,000,000 people were killed in the
retributive genocide between the religions. UNHCR estimates 14 million
Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims were displaced during the partition; it was
the largest mass migration in human history."


## Rationale

I would love to add a link to a primer on colonial India, independence,
and partition to the pre-work. But I don't know of a good, brief
introduction to this complex topic.
