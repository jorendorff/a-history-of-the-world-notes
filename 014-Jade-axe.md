Where is Brittany?

Where is Scandanavia?

Where is the Near East?

Where are the Alps?

What are jade, jadeite, and jadeitite? How are they different from one
another?

## Discussion

How were axes important to the Britain's first farmers?

The program speaks of a "new wooden world". What sorts of wooden
things did these people build?

Do you own anything that is expensive but has no practical purpose?

What is the evidence that the jade axe is not a real tool?

How was the axe made?

"By using a scientific technique developed by astronomers, the
geological signature of any piece of jade can be precisely identified
and matched." What sort of technique might this be?

Does the presence of this jade axe from Italy in Britain convince you
that there were "well established trade routes" across Europe during
this time? Remember, this is centuries before the first European
cities. How else could the axe have ended up in Britain?

If the program's guesses at the story of the axe are correct, what does
that imply about the people who lived in Europe at this time? Did they
necessarily speak the same language from present-day northern Italy,
through France, all the way to Canterbury? Were there traveling
merchants? Were there roads? Was there money? (For that matter, is there
a single language or a single currency across all these places today?)

Perhaps the axe was not moved to Britain until a few thousand years
after it was made. By 125 AD, the Roman empire would control the entire
region and build a network of excellent roads. What evidence would
convince you that this was *not* the case, that the axe made its way
Britain shortly after it was made?

"In Britain, six thousand years ago, the rarity, the beautiful working
and the distant origins of this foreign material would have given our
axe a very high value[.]" What makes things valuable today? The same
things?

(research) What does "the first Stonehenge" mean? How many are there?

What were Stone Age axe handles like?
[Here's a picture of one](http://www.pasthorizonspr.com/index.php/archives/11/2014/well-preserved-5500-year-old-hafted-flint-axe-found-in-denmark),
unreasonably well preserved.

As you might expect after looking at the pictures, "Most axe handles
eventually fail from splitting."

The "technique developed by astronomers" is
[spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy).  It's quite
useful to archaeologists, because it can create an image of the chemical
composition of an object without damaging it. That is, you don't have to
break off a bit of a unique, ancient artifact and dissolve it in a
solution—you just bounce laser light off it.
