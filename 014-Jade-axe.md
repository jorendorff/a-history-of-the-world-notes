## Discussion

How were axes important to the Britain's first farmers? The program
speaks of a "new wooden world". What sorts of wooden artifacts did these
people build?

What is the evidence that the jade axe is not a real tool?

"By using a scientific technique developed by astronomers, the
geological signature of any piece of jade can be precisely identified
and matched." What sort of technique might this be?

If the program's guesses at the story of the axe are correct, what does
that imply about the people who lived in Europe at this time? Did they
necessarily speak the same language from present-day northern Italy,
through France, all the way to Canterbury? Were there traveling
merchants? Was there money? (For that matter, is there a single currency
across all these places today?)

"still remains hopelessly fascinated by prehistoric stone tools."

What were Stone Age axe handles like?
[Here's a picture of one](http://www.pasthorizonspr.com/index.php/archives/11/2014/well-preserved-5500-year-old-hafted-flint-axe-found-in-denmark),
unreasonably well preserved.

As you might expect after looking at the pictures, "Most axe handles
eventually fail from splitting."
