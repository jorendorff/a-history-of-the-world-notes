## Discussion

Ramesses II "was still worshipped as a god in the time of Cleopatra,
over 1000 years later". Can you name any world leaders from 1000 years
ago?

(research) Ramesses II was "lucky" that the Nile flooded regularly
during his reign. Why? A thousand years earlier, from 2200 to 2150 BC, a
severe drought prevented the normal floods. What happened?

(math) How much did the statue originally weigh? How many people would
it take to move it?

The episode lists a few of the considerations involved in producing the
statue, aside from the brute force needed to move the stone. What are
some of those other concerns? Can you think of more? What kind of math
would you need to be able to do?

Antony Gormley calls the statue "a celebration of what a people can do
together".  He says, "[T]hat is the other extraordinary thing about
Egyptian both architecture and sculpture. This is engaged upon by vast
numbers of people, and is an absolutely collective act of celebration of
what they are able to achieve, as a united body of intention." Are there
similar group efforts involving teams of hundreds today?

When the statue arrived in England in the early 1800s, it "began a
revolution in how we Europeans view the history of our culture". What
revolution?

(timeline) Now is a good time to update your timeline with the cultures
and artifacts from episodes 16-20.

(research) A single person is the subject of a stunning proportion of
the world's tallest statues. Who?
