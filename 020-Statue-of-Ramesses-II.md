# 20. Statue of Ramesses II

Granite  
around 1250 BC  
Thebes, Egypt


## ??? notes

inspired Shelley's "Ozymandius"

ruled for 66 years starting 1279 BC, lived to be 90, had 100 kids

Statue was the largest ever seen in Britain when it arrived, and drove home the scale of Egyptian achievement

military campaigns

was still worshipped as a god in the time of Cleopatra, over 1000 years later

Ramesseum temple complex: palace, treasuries, courtyards

(Antony Gormley) "waiting property of sculpture", all Egyptian sculpture
is tinged with death, is a product of a whole people, "This surface is
created entirely by sand abrasion. It's difficult to conceive of a
harder material - this is granite - extreme resistance has been overcome
by time and elbow grease."

required a well-oiled bureaucracy (is this what it required? anything else?)

Ramesses' propaganda - would have monuments to other people re-inscribed
lol; claimed victory over the Hittites that was phony, it was a tie

Belzoni moves the statue with human workers and wooden rollers. "It is a
powerful demonstration of Ramesses' achievement, that just moving half
the statue was considered a great technical feat three thousand years
later."

How much would the whole statue have weighed? How many people would it take to move it?

One of the first pieces to challenge the prevailing view that great art
began in Greece.


## Before listening

What is abrasion?

Where is Abu Simbel and what's there?

Where is Luxor?

What is a circus strong man?

What are hydraulics?

Where is Mt. Rushmore?

## Discussion

(research) Ramesses II was "lucky" that the Nile flooded regularly during his reign. Why? (???ISTR that eventually there was a long bad stretch that completely discredited the pharaohs)
