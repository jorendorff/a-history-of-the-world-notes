## Before listening

What is a cobble?

Where is Olduvai Gorge?

What is a marrow scoop?

## After listening

[This video shows David Attenborough holding the Olduvai
stone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWN5YtIf16k&t=0m55s).
It looks like a rock.
How do we know it is a tool, made by a person for a purpose?

How do we know it's so old?

Why are stone tools linked with human intelligence?

The program claims that two things set human toolmaking apart from
toolmaking in other animal species. What are they?

Is it true that "we can't survive without the things we make"?
What things do modern humans rely on?

Why was this object selected for the program?

On a timeline showing the making of this tool and the present day, where
would the mummy of Hornedjitef fit in? Closer to which end?
