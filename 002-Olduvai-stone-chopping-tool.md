# 2. Olduvai stone chopping tool

Basalt  
Olduvai Gorge  
about 2 million years ago


## Before listening

What is a cobble?

Where is Olduvai Gorge?

What is a marrow scoop?

What does *versatile* mean?

## After listening

[This video shows David Attenborough holding the Olduvai
stone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWN5YtIf16k&t=0m55s).
It looks like a rock.
How do we know it is a tool, made by a person for a purpose?

How do we know it's so old?

The program claims that two things set human toolmaking apart from
toolmaking in other animal species. What are they?

The program says that this stone tool played a part in the development
of human intelligence. How?

Is it true that "we can't survive without the things we make"?
What things do modern humans rely on?

Why was this object selected for the program?

Draw a timeline showing the making of this tool on the left end, and the
present day on the right. Now add the mummy of Hornedjitef to the
timeline.  (It was made around 240 BC.)

## Rationale

I included the "timeline" question to convey the time scale we're
talking about here.

Doing a timeline properly requires some math, but it's easy math. You
can start by figuring out what distance along your timeline equals one
year of time. Measure the distance between the two dots on your timeline
that mark "two million years ago" and "now". That length—perhaps ten
inches—represents two million years, right? So divide by two million and
you get the length that represents one year. Then multiply that by the
number of years between 240 BC and the present to get the distance
between Hornedjitef and the present day. It is a short distance. The
first time I tried it, Hornedjitef's place along the timeline was
*inside* the fat pencil mark that I had labeled "now".
