## ??? Notes

Three stories:

*   a weak ruler, Ptolemy V

    Where did the Ptolemies come from?

    Ahdaf Soueif says at the beginning of the episode: "I think it's
    quite weird. Why you would put this sort of statement, which is
    basically a statement of tax exemption, on such a heavy stone! It is
    760 kilograms. Why did they do that?" How many copies of the Rosetta
    stone were made? Why *did* they do that?

    Why did Ptolemy need the priests' help?

    What three scripts appear on the stone?


*   Britain vs. France.

    1798 Napoleon's invasion of Egypt

    Nelson and the Battle of the Nile

    the Treaty of Alexandria "included the handing over of antiquities" (!)

    "another European adventure"

    Ahdaf Soueif: "No one seems to have considered that it belonged to
    neither of them." "Egypt's foreign rulers [...] have always made
    free with Egypt's heritage."

    "Nasser ... two more since, although with varying results." What is
    she talking about? The government has changed hands again since this
    statement was recorded...

*   The deciphering of the hieroglyphs

    Thomas Young's discovery that Ptolemy is spelled phonetically in the
    hieroglyphs.

    Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion realized the hieroglyphs are "both
    pictorial *and* phonetic". Find the stone slab icon referred to.

How did the Ptolemies' dynasty come to an end?
