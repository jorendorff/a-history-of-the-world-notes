## ??? notes

"And without that Jewish break with the world of myth, we would never
have had science." - Jonathan Sacks. what means?

raised big questions about religion and truth - 12 years after Darwin's _Origin of the Species_

the tablet can be read two ways: it is simple factual confirmation of
the Biblical account; or else shows that it's all mythology

Chief Rabbi, Jonathan Sacks: "the story becomes moralised" A+

It is part of the Epic of Gilgamesh. (!)

"they were learnt by heart." How do we know this?

Written literature can be translated.

"[L]iterature like Gilgamesh allows us not just to think our own
thoughts, but to inhabit the thought worlds of others - and that for me
is also the point of the Museum, and the power of the objects that make
up this thread of human history that I'm tracing. They lead us to other
existences." A+

another story of someone running around naked after making an exciting
discovery. Do you know the story?
