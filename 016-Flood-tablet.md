## Discussion

When and where was this tablet made? What evidence is there that the
Flood story was already old by that time?

George Smith's strange behavior on translating the tablet brings to mind
another story of someone running around naked after making an exciting
discovery. Do you know the story?

The episode mentions that the contents of the tablet were published
"only 12 years after Darwin's _Origin of Species_".
Why is that relevant?

David Damrosch points out it was immediately recognized in 1872 "that
the tablet could be read [...] in two quite different ways". This isn't
so much about the tablet itself as a broader debate that was raging at
the time, one that continues to this day. What are the two contending
views?  How does the tablet fit into each of them?

Jonathan Sacks describes what he sees as a crucial difference between
the flood tablet, which tells "of the great forces of nature being
controlled by deities who don't like human beings very much, and for
whom 'might makes right'," and the Bible's telling of the same story.
What difference?

The Epic of Gilgamesh marks "a turning point in the story of writing".
How so?

In particular: "Literature written down like this can always become
world literature." Why?

The episode closes with a few sentences connecting the purpose of
literature with the purpose of museums. What is the common thread?

[George Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Smith_%28Assyriologist%29),
the Assyriologist who first translated the tablet. A few years earlier,
Smith discovered an inscription describing "a total eclipse of the sun
in the month of Sivan". By connecting this event to a known eclipse in
763 BC, Smith learned how years in our calendar line up with those in
the Assyrian calendar. According to the article, "This discovery is the
cornerstone of ancient Near Eastern chronology."

The Epic of Gilgamesh is amazing and everyone should read it.
But [a faithful translation of the original Akkadian
tablets](http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/mesopotamian/gilgamesh/tab1.htm)
is an odd read. The source material is so fragmentary that it's like
reading a half-finished crossword puzzle. The 1999 Penguin Classics
edition by Andrew George is one of those. Consider instead
the [1960 prose version by Nancy
Sandars](https://www.amazon.com/EPIC-GILGAMESH-Penguin-classics/dp/B003VN9J6E/).
She weaves together multiple sources, spanning centuries, and fills the
gaps with her best guesses. Or try [the vividly illustrated picture book

## Rationale

The last discussion question is about this passage:

> [L]iterature like Gilgamesh allows us not just to think our own
> thoughts, but to inhabit the thought worlds of others - and that for me
> is also the point of the Museum, and the power of the objects that make
> up this thread of human history that I'm tracing. They lead us to other
> existences.

To me, this is a satisfying answer to the perennial question "Why study
history?" and one of the best bits of the series so far.
