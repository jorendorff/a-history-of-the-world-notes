## Discussion

How long did Kushite rule of Egypt last?

The Kushites "used the existing symbols and vocabulary of power" of the
Egyptian Empire. What does this mean? What do symbols and vocabulary
have to do with sustaining imperial control over a territory?

The episode says that the sphinx "combines the present with the long
distant past." What does that mean?

Why did the Kushites want to be seen as pharaohs in the Egyptian
tradition, rather than a conquering external power? Why did later
dynasties also portray them this way?

This episode describes the border between Sudan and Egypt as "a constant
fault line, both geographic and political". What makes it a natural
border?
