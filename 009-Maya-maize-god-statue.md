## Discussion

The program says that as people developed staple crops, 5,000 to 10,000
years ago, "everywhere stories about gods emerged". How do we know about
these stories? (research) Did the Maya leave behind any writing? Why do
we think this statue depicts a god?

Why was maize so important to the Maya? Why didn't they eat wheat?

The program says that nine thousand years ago, raw maize was inedible:
it had to be boiled in lime. Modern corn still has to be cooked, but not
in lime. What changed?

The program ends with the observation that "genetic modification of
crops still causes deep unease, as much religious as scientific - a
sense that the natural order is being disturbed, that humans are
trespassing on territory that's properly reserved for the gods." What do
you think?

(research) Corn and beans are traditionally eaten together. Why?

(research) What is the biggest agricultural product of the United States
today?
