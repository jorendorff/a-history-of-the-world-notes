# 29. Olmec stone mask

Stone  
2,500 years ago  
Mexico


## ??? notes

polished green stone
Olmec civilization? Mexico, 1400-400 BC?
Mother culture - why?
lowland rain forests (in Mexico?!)
equal to Egypt in continuity (really?!)
cities, starmaps, calendars, writing
playing ball
"the rubber country"?
Radiocarbon dating arrived in the 1950s (good research topic)
Carlos Fuentes
Olmec masks are kind of a thing
hard to believe isolation
centrality axis
revered ancestor
"lord of the double scroll"
acid soil
cheek plugs
cranial deformation
abandoned cities, why?
wait, what is that huge city... 240 feet up?!
