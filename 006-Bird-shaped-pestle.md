Stone  
4,000 - 8,000 years ago  
Papua New Guinea


## Before listening

Where is Papua New Guinea?

What is taro?

What does *intrepid* mean?

What are "degrees Centigrade"?

What is a pestle? (In the program, Neil MacGregor distinctly pronounces
the *t* in this word, but most people don't. Usually, *pestle* rhymes
with *vessel*.)

What was Concorde? (Outside the UK, it's called "the Concorde".)

What is a surplus?

What is a patina?

What was the Fertile Crescent?

## Discussion

At the end of the last Ice Age, sea levels rose 100 meters. Can you name
something 100 meters tall? What's the elevation of your home above the
current sea level?

This episode covers a change in the earth and a very dramatic change in
how people lived. What are they?  (The end of the most recent Ice Age,
which means the earth heats 7 degrees Celsius in 100 years; the start of
agriculture, and cooking in particular.)

Why is the pestle evidence of agriculture?

The discovery of such early agriculture on Papua New Guinea was a
surprise. Why?

The program says that we used to think that agriculture was discovered
just once, in the Fertile Crescent and then spread all over the
world. Now we know it "happened simultaneously in many different
places".  How do we know? And if it's true, isn't this a weird
coincidence? How can it be explained?

How did cooking help humans find an evolutionary niche where they
weren't competing with other species for food?

How do we know that women ground the wheat in the Middle East?

Are you convinced that "sharing food is [a way] of binding people
together"?

[Madhur Jaffrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhur_Jaffrey) (who uses
her mortar and pestle to this day) learned to cook by necessity after
moving from India to the UK, which had no decent Indian food at the
time. Her 1973 cookbook, *An Invitation to Indian Cooking*, is credited
with introducing Indian food to UK and American cooks.

Agriculture seems to have begun independently in at least ten different
places all over the world. But
[it was a gradual process](http://www.ancient.eu/timeline/Agriculture/):
there are signs of agriculture in the Middle East as early as 11,000
years ago, but the first animals weren't domesticated until 9,000 years
ago; irrigation and the plow didn't come along until about 8,000 to
7,000 years ago.
