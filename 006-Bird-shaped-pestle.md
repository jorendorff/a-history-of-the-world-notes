Stone  
4,000 - 8,000 years ago  
Papua New Guinea


## Before listening

Where is Papua New Guinea?

What is taro?

What does *intrepid* mean?

What are "degrees Centigrade"?

What is a pestle? (In the program, Neil MacGregor distinctly pronounces
the *t* in this word, but most people don't. Usually, *pestle* rhymes
with *vessel*.)

What was Concorde? (Outside the UK, it's called "the Concorde".)

What is a surplus?

What is a patina?

What was the Fertile Crescent?

## Discussion

At the end of the last Ice Age, sea levels rose 100 meters. Can you name
something 100 meters tall? What's the elevation of your home above the
current sea level?

Why is the pestle evidence of agriculture?

Martin Jones believes cooking helped give humans an evolutionary
advantage. What did he say about this? What do you think?

How do we know that women ground the wheat in the Middle East?

The discovery of such early agriculture in Papua New Guinea was a
surprise. Why?

The program says that we used to think that agriculture was discovered
just once, in the Fertile Crescent and then spread all over the
world. Now we know it "happened simultaneously in many different
places".  How do we know? And if it's true, isn't this a weird
coincidence? How can it be explained?

Do you agree that "sharing food is [a way] of binding people together"?

[Madhur Jaffrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhur_Jaffrey) (who uses
her mortar and pestle to this day) learned to cook by necessity after
moving from India to the UK, which had no decent Indian food at the
time. Her 1973 cookbook, *An Invitation to Indian Cooking*, is credited
with introducing Indian food to UK and American cooks.

Agriculture seems to have begun independently in at least ten different
places all over the world, with different staple crops and animals
domesticated in each. Robert W. Strayer's brilliant high school textbook
[*Ways of the World*](https://www.amazon.com/Ways-World-Global-History-Sources/dp/0312644663)
includes a map and a lot more information about the dawn of agriculture.
For example, Strayer offers an explanation for the weird coincidence of
agriculture having arisen in many places simultaneously:

> What triggered the transition to agriculture, it seems, was a cold and
> dry spell between 11,000 and 9500 B.C.E., a temporary interruption in
> the general process of global warming. Larger settled populations were
> now threatened with the loss of the wild plants and animals on which
> they had come to depend. Their solution was domestication. In the
> millennium or so after 9000 B.C.E., figs, wheat, barley, rye, peas,
> lentils, sheep, goats, pigs, and cattle all came under human control,
> providing the foundation for the world's first, and most productive,
> agricultural societies.
