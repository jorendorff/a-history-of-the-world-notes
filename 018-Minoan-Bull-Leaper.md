## Discussion

What is bronze?

Why was there a "Bronze Age"? That is, practically speaking, why did
bronze ultimately play such a huge role in history? Why not copper or
gold?

How do we know that the Minoans traded by sea?

What evidence does the statue offer that tin was in short supply when it
was made? What reason is given for this shortage?

What is the lost wax technique?

Lucy Blue laments: "Unfortunately, we have only a limited number of
shipwrecks [...]." Why is this so unfortunate (for archaeologists, at
least)?

(research) How large must a ship be in order to carry 15 tons of cargo?

Why do you think so many depictions of bulls were found on Crete?
Suppose archaologists a thousand years from now decide to excavate the
region where you live. Will they find a lot of pictures of any
particular kind of animal?

[The Cities of Crete](http://gogreece.about.com/od/crete/a/The-Cities-Of-Crete.htm).
"[...]Crete was known as an island of cities, ninety of them, according
to Homer. While these ancient sites were hardly 'cities' in the more
modern sense, they were centers of trade, industry, government, and
defense." Today, six cities and towns on Crete have populations over 10,000.

(Neither the bull nor any participant is injured in this video.
Bullfighting is widely seen as a horrifying blood sport; this is tame
and clean by comparison, but to my eye, an element of cruelty remains.)

The [Uluburun Shipwreck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uluburun_shipwreck)
was a late Bronze Age shipwreck, ca. 1310 BC,
discovered off the Turkish coast in 1982.
Divers with the [Institute of Nautical Archaeology](http://nauticalarch.org/featured-projects/)
spent 11 years [excavating](http://nauticalarch.org/projects/uluburun-late-bronze-age-shipwreck-excavation/)
the wreck. The ship's cargo included not only copper and tin ingots but
pottery, jewelry, weapons, olives, glass ingots, unworked elephant
tusks, ostrich eggshells, and
[faience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faience) beads.
