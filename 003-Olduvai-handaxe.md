## Discussion

What's the difference between the handaxe and the Olduvai chopping tool
from the previous episode?

The program talks about the multiple uses of the handaxe, saying that
the sharp point can be used as a drill. What do you think Stone Age
people needed a drill for?

Why might this handaxe be associated with human speech?

Does it take more planning to make a handaxe, compared to the chopping
tool?

Does the handaxe make travel possible?

Did the people who made the Olduvai handaxe make other tools as well?
Did they use other materials for their tools? (Hint: How many things of
yours would leave no trace at all if you set them outside and waited one
million years?) The book *Stone Age Boy* by Satoshi Kitamura shows
prehistoric people using a variety of tools. Is it set in the time of
this handaxe, or later?

The program says the handaxe was the "cutting edge of technology" for a
million years. Does the program explain why technology didn't advance
for such a long period of time? What do you think?
