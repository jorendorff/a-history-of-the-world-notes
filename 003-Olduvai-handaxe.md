## Discussion

What's the difference between the handaxe and the Olduvai chopping tool
from the previous episode?

The program talks about the multiple uses of the handaxe, saying that
the sharp point can be used as a drill. What do you think Stone Age
people needed a drill for?

Why might this handaxe be associated with human speech?

Does it take more planning to make a handaxe, compared to the chopping
tool?

Does the handaxe make travel possible?

Did the people who made the Olduvai handaxe make other tools as well?
Did they use other materials for their tools? (Hint: How many things of
yours would leave no trace at all if you set them outside and waited one
million years?) The book *Stone Age Boy* by Satoshi Kitamura shows
prehistoric people using a variety of tools. Is it set in the time of
this handaxe, or later?

The program says the handaxe was the "cutting edge of technology" for a
million years. Does the program explain why technology didn't advance
for such a long period of time? What do you think? (Some papers linked
below hint at an answer.)

British field archaeologist and expert flint-knapper. "As a young boy,
Harding became fascinated with the Stone Age period, and it was then he
learned flint-knapping from his uncle Fred, and within only a few months
became a skilled knapper, crafting many different hunting tools from
pieces of flint."  "After Harding left school he worked in a puppet
factory in Marlborough, until he became a full-time archaeologist
in 1971."

of a wheel."

D, Chaminade T (2009) CAJ. From the abstract: "Recent functional brain
imaging studies of stone tool-making [...] demonstrate overlap with
neural circuits involved in language processing [, ...] consistent with
the hypothesis that language and tool-making [...] evolved together in a
mutually reinforcing way."

[The Manipulative Complexity of Lower Paleolithic Stone
Toolmaking](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47756068). Faisal
A, Stout D, Apel J, Bradley B (2010) PLoS ONE. The authors used a data
glove to record the motions of an expert knapper making stone tools in
two styles. (The Olduvai handaxe of this program is the older of the two
styles.) The study "is consistent with a scenario in which the earliest
stages of human technological evolution depended on novel
perceptual-motor capacities (such as the control of joint stiffness)
whereas later developments increasingly relied on enhanced mechanisms
for cognitive control" and "suggests possible links between toolmaking
and language evolution".
