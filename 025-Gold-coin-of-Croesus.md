# 25. Gold coin of Croesus

Gold  
around 550 BC  
minted in Turkey


## Before listening

What does it mean to *coin a phrase*?

Where was the ancient kingdom of Lydia?

What is a *lentil*? How big is it?

What is Goldman Sachs?

The phrase "gold standard" has both a literal meaning and a figurative
meaning. What are they?

## Discussion

What are the benefits and drawbacks of living in a society that has money?

Is it true that "inequality of fortunes" is impossible without money?
Were the fortunes of everyone in ancient Egypt equal until the invention
of coins in 550 BC?

The episode mentions the possibility of trading with strangers that you
can't necessarily trust. You might say that money helps sellers trust
buyers. But what allows buyers to trust sellers? Do you ever buy things
from strangers? What makes you trust them?

Why did the invention of coinage make the Lydians so rich? The episode
says something about speeding up trade; but so what? Why would that
make the kingdom richer?

(timeline) Now is a good time to update your timeline with the cultures
and artifacts from episodes 21-25.

["The Zoo Economy"](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/09/09/493295430/episode-566-the-zoo-economy),
an episode of the podcast *Planet Money*,
describes a modern-day economy that functions without money
(unless jellyfish can be considered money).

[Gold parting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_parting) is the
refinement of electrum (gold-silver alloy) into pure gold. The episode
describes the process of salt cementation, which the Lydians must have
used; but no clear written account of the process survived (indeed
there are only a hundred or so extant texts in the
[Lydian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydian_language).
The earliest surviving description of salt cementation is from the early
1100s AD.

These days, gold is mostly purified either using chlorine gas, which is poisonous
(the [Miller process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_process));
or electrolysis
(the [Wohlwill process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wohlwill_process)),
which produces a purer result, but requires a large up-front investment:
the acid you use must be saturated with dissolved gold!

The episode mentions that Lydian trade made Croesus so rich that he was
able to build one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World: the [Temple
of Artemis at Ephesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Artemis).
According to Wikipedia,

> Antipater of Sidon, who compiled the list of the Seven Wonders, describes the finished temple:
>
> > I have set eyes on the wall of lofty Babylon on which is a road for
> > chariots, and the statue of Zeus by the Alpheus, and the hanging
> > gardens, and the colossus of the Sun, and the huge labour of the high
> > pyramids, and the vast tomb of Mausolus; but when I saw the house of
> > Artemis that mounted to the clouds, those other marvels lost their
> > brilliancy, and I said, "Lo, apart from Olympus, the Sun never looked
> > on aught so grand".

[Fred Goodwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Goodwin) was a
banker. The podcast refers to him as *Sir* Fred Goodwin, because at the
time it was made, he had been knighted ("for his services to the banking
industry"), but the honor was annulled following the near-collapse of
his bank in the 2008 financial crisis.

Scottish novelist and historian [James

Inquiry into the Meaning of
Money*](https://www.amazon.com/Frozen-Desire-Meaning-James-Buchan/dp/1566491800/).

Paul Craddock edited several books of scholarly articles on historical
metallurgy and mining, including [*King Croesus'

## Rationale

Everyone has views on money. I have a few of my own! I have tried to
keep them out of the discussion questions. The hope is that these
questions will stimulate teacher-student discussion rather than drive
home political points that have anything to do with me. Let me know how
to improve them.
