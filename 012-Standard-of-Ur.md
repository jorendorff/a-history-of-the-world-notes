Who was Karl Marx? What are class conflicts?

Where was Ur?

## Discussion

The program implies that a small farming village, like the one that
produced the Egyptian clay cattle, could not have produced a work of art
like the Standard of Ur. Why not? What are the necessary ingredients for
this kind of art, and what kind of society is required to obtain them?

One of the ingredients listed in the program was "craftsmen able to
specialise in making complex luxury objects". What other objects are
shown in the Standard that may have been made by specialists?

How does agricultural surplus lead to the emergence of classes?

How are supplies and labor arranged to produce artwork now?

What kind of vehicle is portrayed on the "war" side of the standard?
Have we seen vehicles before in this series? (research) When was the
wheel invented?

What objects shown on the standard seem to have been made of metal?
(Hint: One item in particular, a ring, is easy to miss, but it's hard to
see how it could be made of anything else.) (research) Did the Sumerians
have metalworking at this time? What kind? Could the weapons shown on
the standard be metal swords?
