## Discussion

What can clothes tell us about the economics of an ancient society?
Power structures? Climate? Customs?

Why are we only now getting the first example of clothing in the series?

This episode emphasizes the organization and coordination required to
create the textile. Do you remember this theme coming up in other
episodes? Why do you think the program focuses on this?

(research) The episode notes that each color in the textile is obtained
from some something specific in nature: plant roots and molluscs are
mentioned. How are pigments obtained today? Do we now have some single
chemical or formula that can produce the whole range of colors? Or are
many different substances still used? Are pigments from nature still
common?

The [Paracas culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracas_culture),
which created these textiles, predated the Inca Empire by some 1,700
years. It is known mainly from its burial sites, particularly the
necropolis of Wari Kayan, where burials continued until about 250 AD.

Textiles](http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1323&context=tsaconf) -
A 2006 article by Canadian textile expert Mary Frame on the use of knots
to encode information in Andean textiles. "Math is so intermeshed with
the processes of fiber technology and the patterns based on fiber
structures that it is hard to say whether math or fiber technology came
first in ancient Peru â€“ the proverbial chicken and egg."
