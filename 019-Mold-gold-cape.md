## ???notes

Rev. C. B. Clough

"newly identified Age of Bronze - around four thousand years ago"

"It was like a huge three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle, and solving it took nothing less than the re-learning of ancient gold-working techniques that had been lost for millennia." wow

"punched"?

What is Avebury?

The cape is "prehistoric" (how do we know?); description of the surviving evidence of this society (stone circles, burial mounds, tribal roundhouses

copper mine: Great Orme

the archaeological challenge of finding a gold mine

signs of wear on the cape indicate it was worn

was most likely for a teenager; role of the young; the notion of childhood maybe not being so much of a thing; very few old people

illicit excavations: "For although the precious finds will often
survive, the context which explains them will be lost, and it's that
context of material—usually financially worthless—that turns treasure
into history."

What is Cartier? What is Tiffany's?

What are the *workings* of a mine or quarry?

## Discussion

The British Museum had acquired most of the cape by the 1930s, but it
was not reassembled until the 1960s. What took so long?

The program speaks of a recent change in the way historians see
prehistoric British societies. What was this change? What caused
historians to change their minds?

The cape must have been very expensive. Why did it end up in Wales?

"By studying these precious objects - gold, amber, and above all
bronze - we can track a web of trade and exchange that reaches from
North Wales to Scandinavia, and even to the Mediterranean." What does
this mean? What sort of "web" is this exactly, that's being tracked?

(math, research) Marie Louise Sørensen: "We know that in the early
Bronze Age very few people would get older than about 25 years. Most
children would not get older than 5." What is the life expectancy at
birth in the society described here? Life expectancy at birth is
sometimes criticized for being a misleading number. What do you think?
