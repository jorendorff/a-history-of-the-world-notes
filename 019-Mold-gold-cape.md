## Discussion

The cape is described as "punched". What does this mean? How might it
have been done?

The British Museum had acquired most of the cape by the 1930s, but it
was not reassembled until the 1960s. What took so long?

The cape is "prehistoric". What does this mean? What other physical
evidence did the societies of this time in Britain leave behind?

The program speaks of a recent change in the way historians see
prehistoric British societies. What was this change? What caused
historians to change their minds?

"By studying these precious objects - gold, amber, and above all
bronze - we can track a web of trade and exchange that reaches from
North Wales to Scandinavia, and even to the Mediterranean." What does
this mean? What sort of "web" is this exactly, that's being tracked?

The cape must have been very expensive. Why did it end up in Wales?

Why is it harder for archaeologists to find an old gold mine than an old
copper mine?

The episode mentions that the cape shows signs of wear, indicating it
probably was actually used, at least a few times. What might these "signs
of wear" be? (Keep in mind that archaeologists would have to distinguish
them from the kind of wear caused by being crushed to pieces in the
ground over thousands of years, then divvied up and stored in various
places around Wales.)

Would you like to live in a society where young people predominate?
How would it be different?

(research) What percentage of people in your country are under 13? What
percentage are teenagers?

(research) Niel MacGregor: "It's why archaeologists get so agitated
about illicit excavations today. For although the precious finds will
often survive, the context which explains them will be lost, and it's
that context of material—usually financially worthless—that turns
treasure into history."  The Treasure Act 1996 has a provision that
directly addresses this concern about "context". What is it?

## Rationale

Marie Louise Stig Sørensen: "We know that in the early Bronze Age very
few people would get older than about 25 years. Most children would not
get older than 5. [...] That would mean that most people around them
were teenagers, there were very few old people in this kind of society."
The word *most* in the last sentence can't be literally correct. The
number of teenagers in a society can't be greater than the number of
preteens, at steady state.

That much is just nit-picking—but I really think the data's being
misinterpreted. Even very high infant mortality doesn't affect the
demographics of a population much. When you walk into any society and
look around, you're looking at the people who lived.  For the same
reason, it's possible for old people to predominate even in a society
where most people don't live to old age. I wanted to put in some kind of
enlightening question about this, but couldn't find a good angle.
