# 21. Lachish reliefs

Stone  
Around 700 BC  
Northern Iraq


## ??? notes

war on a new scale, around 1000 BC

like an epic film in stone

room full of carvings 8ft high

Sennacherib, ruler of the Assyrian empire, the largest ever at the time

great siege of Lachish, Judea, 701 BC

marching in; gory battle; injured and dead; columns of refugees

Hezekiah rebelled, Assyria marched in; the whole city was depopulated

the carvings are from the palace at Nineveh (how obtained?)

propaganda

one of the earliest representations of refugees

Paddy Ashdown: refugees are a horror to this day; fatalistic attitude
toward both inevitability and immutability of war

heartland of the Assyrian empire was around the Tigris river - it had no natural defenses

long series of wars

Biblical Book of Kings offers one view of the conflict; an Assyrian
account gives the other side. Which view is accurate? The Bible is, after
all, the inspired Word of God. Could they both be accurate?

resettlement of troublesome peoples as strategy; Stalin vs. Sennacherib;
demonstration of power vs. suspicion of treason

the carvings show misery but even more so Sennacherib's moment of triumph
