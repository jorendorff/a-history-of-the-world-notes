## Discussion

How large are the reliefs? What material are they made of? Where were
they kept at the time they were made?

What made Lachish a strategically important city?

The biblical Book of Kings offers one view of the conflict; an Assyrian
account gives the other side. Which view is accurate? Could both be
accurate? When the reliefs were discovered by English archaeologist
Austen Henry Layard in the 1840s, did he see the reliefs as
contradicting or supporting the biblical account?

What is the focus of this episode?

Paddy Ashdown takes a somewhat fatalistic attitude toward war and its
consequences: "What is true, and what the reliefs show, is in a sense
the immutable and unchangeable character of war." Do modern-day wars
still result in refugees? Do you think this is inevitable?

What ultimately happened to Sennacherib?

(research) What happened to the Assyrian Empire?

The [Neo-Assyrian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Assyrian_Empire)
was, in Sennacherib's time, the largest land empire the world had ever
seen. It controlled most of modern-day Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and
Israel.

The episode says that the Bible "glosses over" Sennacherib's conquest of
Judah. II Kings 18:13-16 reads:

> Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of
> Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took
> them. [...] And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the
> house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king's house.  At that
> time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the
> Lord, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid,
> and gave it to the king of Assyria.

The Bible goes on to describe a later confrontation between Sennacherib
and Hezekiah, at Jerusalem, in which God intervenes, killing 185,000
Assyrian soldiers. See
[II Kings 18](https://www.bible.com/bible/1/2KI.18.kjv)
and [19](https://www.bible.com/bible/1/2KI.19.kjv).

[Population transfer in the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_transfer_in_the_Soviet_Union)
(Wikipedia). "According to official Soviet estimates, more than 14
million people passed through the Gulag from 1929 to 1953, with a
further 7 to 8 million being deported and exiled to remote areas of the
Soviet Union (including entire nationalities in several cases)."
